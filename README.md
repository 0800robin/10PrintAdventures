# Adventures in 10 Print 👾

Welcome! 👋👋🏿👋🏽👋🏻👋🏾👋🏼

<a href="http://www.chestervisualarts.org.uk/10print/">Adventures in 10 Print ↗️</a> is an interactive website enabling people of all technical abilities to play around a classic computer art algorithm and see what gets generated. It was created by <a href="https://futurerob.in">Robin Hunter</a>.

This Github repo contains the code which powers the website. You are free to download it, explore how it works & create
'remix' versions of it to your hearts content. 

The rest of this overview is written for beginner programmers who want to learn more about how to explore the code behind
this project & what other cool tech/art resources are out there. 


### How to run this code on your computer

- Click the big green '⬇️ Code' button just above this writing.
- Unzip the file on your computer.
- Double click 'index.html' to run it on your computer.


### How to explore the code

Open this folder up using a text editor, such as <a href="#">VS Code</a>, to explore  the commented code to start learning how it works.

**art.js** - The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps">Javascript</a> code which generates the canvas and shapes on the screen. 

**index.html** - The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">HTML</a> document the web browser presents to the user. This contains the control interface and pulls in the p5 library.

**style.css** - Some basic <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps">CSS</a> which applies a layout and set of styles the whole page so it looks nice. 


### Creative Coding learning resources

If you enjoyed exploring the code for this project & want to dive into the big wide world of programming through art
and media there are a wealth of communities and resources out there.


<a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>: is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. 


<a href="">p5.js</a> is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else.  _Adventures in 10 Print_ uses p5 to draw out shapes onto the screen. 


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw">The Coding Rainbow</a> is an education creative coding YouTube channel from the one and only <a href="https://shiffman.net/">Daniel Shiffman</a>. It is full of tutorials and series about how to make art and interactive systems using code. 


### 10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10

10 PRINT is a book which deep dives into the history of this humble algorithm and the impact it has has on the way
we see computer programs. You can download the free PDF versions here - <a href="https://10print.org/">https://10print.org/</a>

_This book takes a single line of code—the extremely concise BASIC program for the Commodore 64 inscribed in the title—and uses it as a lens through which to consider the phenomenon of creative computing and the way computer programs exist in culture_
